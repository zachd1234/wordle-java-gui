A simple Wordle-style game built in Java using Swing (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, etc.).  
Built to explore GUI development in Java and practice object-oriented design through a fun, interactive project.

## 🧠 What It Does
- Lets you play a Wordle-style guessing game
- Visual grid updates with color-coded feedback (green/yellow/gray)
- Uses a preset word list to validate guesses
- Tracks valid vs. guessable words separately
- Fully offline, local gameplay

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel, GridLayout)
- OOP architecture for game logic and UI separation

## 🧩 Key Components
- `WordleUI.java` — handles layout, event listeners, rendering
- `Words.java` — loads and manages valid words
- `wordle-game-words.txt` — valid solutions
- `wordle-guess-words.txt` — allowed guesses

## 🎮 How to Run
1. Open in any Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, BlueJ, Eclipse)
2. Run `WordleUI.java`
3. Type in your guesses and play!

## 🧠 Why I Built This
I wanted to get more comfortable building GUIs and visual feedback systems in Java.  
Swing is rarely used in modern projects, but it’s a great way to understand layout managers, event-driven design, and game logic.
